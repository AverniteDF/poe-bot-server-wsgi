Could you provide me with sample JSON payloads for bot-to-bot communication on the Poe platform? This would help me implement forwarding user messages to other bots.
Do you have any insights into how Poe handles bot-to-bot communication? Specifically, how are responses formatted when relayed between bots?
Do you know if remote bots like GPT-3.5-Turbo send their responses as streaming events or in a single response? This would help me manage the interaction flow.
Has anyone successfully implemented a synchronous bot that forwards messages to other bots on Poe? I'd love to see the code or get some advice!
What is the expected timeout for receiving a response from a remote bot on Poe? Should my bot retry if the remote bot doesn't respond in time?
How should I handle Poe's 5-second response rule when forwarding messages to other bots? Can I send an initial response while waiting for the remote bot?
